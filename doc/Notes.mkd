# Notes of actions

## Initial setup

Created directory with:

bin
lib/MyAdd/Schema/Result
doc
t

And added the readme.

Added cpanfile, and basic result classes for author and book, as well as schema root file

Note: DH is very specific about the 'databases' attribute, must be SQLite, MySQL or something else... its int he code anyway.
